Graphs, Digraphs, and Trees\n","\n","Graphs, digraphs, and trees are fundamental structures in graph theory\n","that model relationships between objects. <br>\n","Here are the key concepts and definitions.\n","\n","## Graphs\n","\n","A graph is a mathematical structure consisting of a set of vertices\n","(also called nodes) connected by edges. In its simplest form, a graph G\n","is defined as an ordered pair G = (V, E), where V is the set of vertices\n","and E is the set of edges. <br>\n","The order of a graph is the number of vertices, and the size is the\n","number of edges. Two vertices connected by an edge are called adjacent.\n","The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.\n","\n","### Types of Graphs\n","\n","1.  **Simple Graphs**: Graphs with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.\n","2.  **Multigraphs**: These allow multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.\n","3.  **Graphs with Loops**: These permit edges that connect a vertex to     itself.\n","\n","## Digraphs\n","A directed graph (digraph) is similar to a graph, but the edges have a\n","direction associated with them. The edges in a digraph are called directed edges or arcs.\n","\n","### Key Properties of Digraphs\n","\n","1.  **Definition**: Formally, a digraph G is an ordered pair G = (V, A),     where V is the set of vertices and A is the set of ordered pairs of     vertices, called arcs or directed edges.\n","\n","2.  **Orientation**: In a digraph, edges are one-way, represented by arrows pointing from one vertex to another.\n","\n","3.  **Types of Digraphs**:\n","    -   **Simple Digraphs**: No loops or multiple arcs in the same        direction.\n","    -   **Multidigraphs**: Allow multiple arcs between vertices.\n","    -   **Oriented Graphs**: Digraphs with no opposite pairs of directed\n","        edges.\n","\n","4.  **Special Digraphs**:\n","    -   **Tournaments**: Oriented graphs obtained by assigning a        direction to each edge in a complete graph.\n","    -   **Semicomplete Digraphs**: Simple digraphs where there is at         least one arc between each pair of vertices.\n","\n","## Trees\n","A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. Trees are a special type of graph with unique properties that make them particularly useful in various applications and have many applications in modeling hierarchical relationships.<br>\n","Key properties of trees include:\n","\n","-   A tree with n vertices has exactly n-1 edges.\n","-   There is a unique path between any two vertices.\n","-   Adding any edge to a tree creates exactly one cycle.\n","-   Removing any edge disconnects the tree.\n","\n","###Types of Trees\n","1.  **Rooted Trees**: Trees with a designated root vertex.\n","2.  **Directed Trees (Polytrees)**: Directed acyclic graphs whose     underlying undirected graph is a tree.\n","3.  **Arborescences (Out-trees)**: Rooted directed trees where all edges     point away from the root.\n","4.  **In-trees**: Rooted directed trees where all edges point towards the root.\n","5. **Spanning tree**: A tree that includes all vertices of a graph.\n","6. **Minimum spanning tree**: A spanning tree of minimum total edge weight in a weighted graph.\n","\n","\n","### Defining Characteristics of Trees\n","\n","1.  **Acyclic**: Trees contain no cycles.\n","2.  **Connected**: There is exactly one path between any two vertices in a tree.\n","3.  **Minimal Connectivity**: Removing any edge from a tree disconnects it.\n","4.  **Edge Count**: A tree with n vertices has exactly n-1 edges.\n","\n","\n","### Theorem\n","\n","Every acyclic and connected graph is a tree and vice versa\n","\n","#### Demosntration\n","Part 1: Every acyclic and connected\n","graph is a tree Let G be an acyclic and connected graph. We can prove G\n","is a tree by showing it satisfies the definition of a tree:\n","\n","1.  G is connected (given)\n","2.  G is acyclic (given)\n","\n","These two properties are sufficient to define a tree. Therefore, G is a tree. Part 2: Every tree is an acyclic and connected graph Now, let T be a tree. We need to prove that T is both acyclic and connected.\n","\n","1.  Connectedness: By definition, a tree is connected.\n","2.  Acyclicity: We can prove this by contradiction. Suppose T contains a     cycle C. Let e be an edge in C. If we remove e, the graph T - e would still be connected because the remaining edges of C provide an alternate path between the vertices of e. However, this contradicts a fundamental property of trees: removing any edge from a tree disconnects it. Therefore, our assumption that T contains a cycle must be false, proving that T is acyclic.\n","\n","Mathematical representation: <br>\n","Let G = (V, E) be a graph where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges.\n","\n","$$\\text{G is a tree}\\iff \\text{G is connected and acyclic}$$\n","\n","Additional properties that further characterize trees:\n","\n","1.  For a tree T with n vertices:  \n","    $|E|=n-1$\n","2.  There exists a unique path between any two vertices u and v in a tree:  \n","    $\\forall u,v\\in V,\\exists!\\text{ path }P_{uv}$\n","3.  Adding any edge e to a tree T creates exactly one cycle:  \n","    $T'=(V,E\\cup \\{e\\})\\text{ contains exactly one cycle}$\n","\n","These properties provide multiple equivalent ways to define and characterize trees, reinforcing the relationship between acyclic connected graphs and trees.\n","\n"],"id":"1df1604c-55f9-4ba6-9e1e-d9590979733d"}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5,"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]}}}
