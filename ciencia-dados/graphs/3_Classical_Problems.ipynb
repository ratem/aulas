{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Classical Problems: Coloring, Routing, Spanning Tree\n","\n","Graph theory encompasses several fundamental problems that have shaped\n","both theoretical computer science and practical applications. The\n","classical problems of graph coloring, routing, and spanning trees\n","represent cornerstone concepts that demonstrate the elegance and utility\n","of graph-theoretic approaches to complex computational challenges.\n","\n","## Graph Coloring\n","\n","Graph coloring constitutes a systematic assignment of labels,\n","traditionally termed “colors,” to elements of a graph subject to\n","specific constraints[1]. The vertex coloring problem requires that no\n","two adjacent vertices share the same color, while edge coloring demands\n","that no two incident edges receive identical colors.\n","\n","**Mathematical Foundation**\n","\n","The chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ represents the minimum number of colors\n","required for proper vertex coloring of graph $G$. For edge coloring, the\n","edge chromatic number $\\chi'(G)$ denotes the minimum colors needed for\n","proper edge coloring[2]. The chromatic polynomial $P(G,t)$ counts the\n","number of proper $t$-colorings of graph $G$[3].\n","\n","The chromatic polynomial satisfies the deletion-contraction recurrence\n","relation: $P(G-uv,k) = P(G/uv,k) + P(G,k)$ where $u$ and $v$ are\n","adjacent vertices, $G-uv$ represents the graph with edge $uv$ removed,\n","and $G/uv$ denotes the contracted graph[4].\n","\n","**Applications**\n","\n","Graph coloring finds extensive applications across diverse domains. The\n","famous four-color theorem demonstrates that any planar map can be\n","colored using at most four colors such that no adjacent regions share\n","the same color[5]. In computational contexts, graph coloring assists in\n","solving Sudoku puzzles by modeling constraints as graph adjacencies[6].\n","Additionally, coloring algorithms prove essential in register\n","allocation, scheduling problems, and frequency assignment in wireless\n","networks[7].\n","\n","**Python Implementation**\n","\n","The greedy coloring algorithm operates by sequentially assigning the\n","lowest available color to each vertex, ensuring no adjacent vertices\n","share identical colors[8].\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Zhslw29-J7MI"},"id":"Zhslw29-J7MI"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class Graph:\n","    def __init__(self, vertices):\n","        self.V = vertices\n","        self.graph = [[0 for _ in range(vertices)] for _ in range(vertices)]\n","\n","    def add_edge(self, u, v):\n","        self.graph[u][v] = 1\n","        self.graph[v][u] = 1\n","\n","    def greedy_coloring(self):\n","        result = [-1] * self.V\n","        result[0] = 0\n","\n","        for u in range(1, self.V):\n","            available = [True] * self.V\n","\n","            for v in range(self.V):\n","                if self.graph[u][v] == 1 and result[v] != -1:\n","                    available[result[v]] = False\n","\n","            color = 0\n","            while color < self.V:\n","                if available[color]:\n","                    break\n","                color += 1\n","\n","            result[u] = color\n","\n","        return result\n","\n","# Example usage\n","g = Graph(5)\n","g.add_edge(0, 1)\n","g.add_edge(0, 2)\n","g.add_edge(1, 2)\n","g.add_edge(1, 3)\n","g.add_edge(2, 4)\n","\n","print(\"Vertex coloring:\", g.greedy_coloring())\n","\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"mtu4sWnzJ7oT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1748893334460,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Rogerio Atem De Carvalho","userId":"11948218971829271066"}},"outputId":"15ca5571-4c84-4108-a05f-9723c1f9a3a0"},"id":"mtu4sWnzJ7oT","execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Vertex coloring: [0, 1, 2, 0, 0]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","## Routing\n","\n","Routing represents a fundamental graph-theoretic approache for\n","determining optimal paths between vertices in weighted graphs.
