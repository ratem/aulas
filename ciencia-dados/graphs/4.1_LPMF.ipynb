This mathematical modeling approach transforms the\n","combinatorial flow optimization into a structured optimization\n","framework.\n","\n","## Standard Linear Programming Formulation\n","\n","The most direct formulation treats each edge flow as a decision\n","variable. For a flow network $G = (V, E)$ with source $s$, sink $t$, and\n","capacity function $c: E \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_0^+$, we define:\n","\n","**Decision Variables:**\n","\n","-   $f(u,v)$ = flow through edge $(u,v) \\in E$\n","\n","**Linear Program:** $\\text{maximize} \\sum_{v:(s,v) \\in E} f(s,v)$\n","\n","subject to:\n","$\\sum_{u:(u,v) \\in E} f(u,v) = \\sum_{w:(v,w) \\in E} f(v,w) \\quad \\forall v \\in V - \\{s,t\\}$\n","$f(u,v) \\leq c(u,v) \\quad \\forall (u,v) \\in E$\n","$f(u,v) \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall (u,v) \\in E$\n","\n","The objective function maximizes the total flow leaving the source\n","node[1][2]. The first constraint ensures **flow conservation** at all\n","intermediate nodes - the amount of flow entering each node equals the\n","amount leaving it[3]. The second constraint enforces **capacity limits**\n","on each edge, while the third ensures **non-negativity** of flows[4][5].\n","\n","## Alternative Formulation with Artificial Arc\n","\n","A mathematically elegant approach introduces an artificial arc from sink\n","back to source with infinite capacity. This allows uniform treatment of\n","all nodes under a single conservation constraint[6]:\n","\n","**Modified Formulation:** $\\text{maximize} \\; x_{ts}$\n","\n","subject to:\n","$\\sum_{j:(i,j) \\in E'} x_{ij} - \\sum_{j:(j,i) \\in E'} x_{ji} = 0 \\quad \\forall i \\in V$\n","$0 \\leq x_{ij} \\leq c_{ij} \\quad \\forall (i,j) \\in E$\n","\n","where $E'$ includes the original edges plus the artificial arc\n","$(t,s)$[7].

Let $P$ denote the set of all simple paths from $s$\n","to $t$:\n","\n","**Path Variables:**\n","\n","-   $x_p$ = flow along path $p \\in P$\n","\n","**Path-Based Linear Program:** $\\text{maximize} \\sum_{p \\in P} x_p$\n","\n","subject to:\n","$\\sum_{p \\in P: (u,v) \\in p} x_p \\leq c(u,v) \\quad \\forall (u,v) \\in E$\n","$x_p \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall p \\in P$\n","\n","This formulation naturally eliminates flow conservation constraints\n","since each path variable represents a complete route from source to\n","sink[9].
